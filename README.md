# Gradient Descent for Neural Networks (and Logistic Regression)

This repository demonstrates the **implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch** and its application to **Logistic Regression** and **Neural Networks** using Python.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand how optimization works **behind the scenes**, instead of relying only on high-level ML libraries.
